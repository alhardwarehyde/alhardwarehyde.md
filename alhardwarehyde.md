# STAFF Winter of Making: DIY Apple Airtags (for the Android User)

## Summary

As some folks in HQ know, my spouse frequently looses thing, we just found their wallet that has been missing since August. We have tried a multitude of strategies and this seems like a fun project to get back into hardware having been out of the game for a few years. I have no experience with bluetooth programming 

## Plan

I am roughly following this tutorial https://makezine.com/projects/find-my-diy-airtag-tracker/
-Order Parts (listed below)
-Figure out code (NRF51822 module coming from AliExpress means may arrive closer to Feb 17th)
-Once Parts get in, assemble!
-Finish Code and test!
-Debug, rinse repeat.
